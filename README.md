# Pizza-Sales-Analysis-on-SQL
In this project, I have utilized SQL queries to solve different questions related to pizza sales, showcasing the power of SQL in unlocking the business intelligence from pizza sales data.
Implemented SQL(JOIN) techniques to integrate data from multiple tables, such as orders, orders_details, and pizza_types, enabling comprehensive analysis of pizza sales by category, size, and customer preferences.
This analysis summarizes the key findings provides actionable recommendations to leverage the insights, and empowers informed decision-making to maximize profitability. 
I have attached a PDF file where I have shown screenshot of every question that I have solved using SQL
